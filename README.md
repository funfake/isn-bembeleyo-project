# `2020` - ISN Project // **Bembeleyo**

## hello there, welcome to BBY's git repository

This project consists of a **birth date based meeeting website** where you can find people that have the same age, date/day of birth than you.
It is meant **to meet new friends, not really to find love**. *For that, sign up on Tinder it'll work better, faster and stronger ;)*

## Let's start by the beginning
---
- clone the repository (first time) : `git clone https://github.com/funfake/isn-bembeleyo-project.git`

    (( looks like a new folder appeared in your current directory ))

## When changes were made, push them !
---
- **lists changes to commit :** `git add -A` (the last argument *tells git to search for EVERYTHING even in folders* and subfolders)


- **instance your list of changes and add comments :** `git commit -m "type your sweet comment about changes you made here"` (if you don't insert the -m "comment" argument, *it will bring you to an editor and allow you to write a longer comment*, with returns and lists for instance)


- **send your changes to the cloud :** `git push (origin branch-name)` ~ you don't always need to specify the branch, if there is no other branch, *it will take `origin master` by default* or if the specified branch doesn't exists, it will create it



### It should all go flawlessly, and if it doesn't, contact me :)
