### installing flask
- main tutorial : https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world
- infos about commands and env variables : https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/cli/
- because Windows is bullshit, to start Flask, you have to `python -m flask run` instead of `flask run` *+ env variables are set/exported/$env differently* https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2083
